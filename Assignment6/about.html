                        <h3>About Us</h3>
                        <p>Welcome to Bun Bun Bakeshop! Angelina and Sharde are sisters who believe that life is sweet. Born out of a family holiday tradition, they decided to make a bakery that would let them share their joy with others. When their grandmother Myrtle died, who is the originator of the recipe, Angelina and Sharde decided that it would be the perfect way to honor her. Myrtle believes that everyone was an artist and food was a great way to express creativity. Thus in 2015, Bun Bun Bakery was born! They aim to bring everyone joy by continiously offering new cinnamon roll combinations that help make life just a little sweeter. The bakery specializes in offering the option to choose from popular exsting options or become your own artist and edit any of the flavor combinations! We hope you will roll through our bakery soon!</p>
